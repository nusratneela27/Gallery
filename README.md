## Features

- **Gallery Layout:** We've created a visually appealing grid layout for the image gallery, making one image the feature image, which stands out.

- **Sorting:** Users can easily rearrange images using a simple drag-and-drop feature for a personalized gallery order.

- **Deleting Multiple Images:** You can select multiple images and delete them with a clear visual indication of your selections.

- **Setting Feature Image:** Sorting images also lets you choose the feature image. The first image (left to right) is set as the featured one.

- **User Experience:** To enhance the user experience, we've added smooth transitions and animations, making the gallery not only functional but visually appealing.
